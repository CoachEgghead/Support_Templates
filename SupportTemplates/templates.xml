    <name>Ping</name>
    <text>1. How To Ping devices in the restaurant
---- Use the 5 digit restaurant number + .pos (Example 01234.pos) 
               C:\Users\jeff.jakes&gt;ping xxxxx.rtr = Router
               C:\Users\jeff.jakes&gt;ping xxxxx.pos = POS server
               C:\Users\jeff.jakes&gt;ping xxxxx.pc = CFA PC/Back Office PC
               C:\Users\jeff.jakes&gt;ping micr.xxxxx =MICR Printer
               C:\Users\jeff.jakes&gt;ping loomis.xxxxx = Smart Safe

To Ping the AP’s, you must take the IP address of the RTR, drop the last number and add the following.
250 -251-252-253-254.
Example: ping 00818.rtr (Enter). You will receive the following results.
Pinging 00818.pos.  [172.18.81.7] 
You would then ping the AP’s by using this IP address, minus the last number and adding the 250-254
Example: ping 172.18.81.250

Router -  command: ping xxxxx.rtr 
POS Server - command: ping xxxxx.pos
CFA PC - command: ping xxxxx.pc
Smart Safe - command: ping loomis.xxxxx
MICR Printer - command: ping micr.xxxxx
Third Party printer - ping printer.xxxxx
DMZ Switch - command: ping dmz.xxxxx

KB0049782

Deferred order 5562246 with zero dollar shows as fired at 9:17pm on 10/16/2017.
Unit is unable to clear it themselves on the POS.

In SSUI:
Query &gt; DB Query
*Using Table Deferred Order, select top 10 * from Deferred_Order where tran_sequence_number = ########

Site Repair &gt; Support Tools (ST)
*Ran Backup Deferred Orders (DO)

In Windows:
** C:\Program Files\Radiant\Lighthouse\Data
*Copied to a new backup folder on desktop called DO_Backup_10172017
*Deleted DeferredOrder5562246.xml

In SSUI ran Restore Deferred Orders

In StoreManagement &gt; Store Operations &gt; Shift Operations verified all cashiers from 10/16/2017 were settled. 
In StoreManagement &gt; Store Operations &gt; End of Day ran EOD.  Successfully moved to 10/17/2017.

***NOTE
Left backup on desktop in case something happened during the restore and some DOs end up missing.  Can copy back the missing ones to C:\Program Files\Radiant\Lighthouse\Data and Restore Deferred Orders to get them back again.</text>

    <text>Multiple Cashiers Unsettled/Missing:
Troubleshooting:
-Verified SQL Server MX, Radiant .NET, MacromatiX Livelink, MacromatiX Updater are all 'Started'.
-Seeing .xml files still sitting in C:\Program Files\Radiant\Lighthouse\Data\Exports\CFASum.
-Verified in SPSM that there are 9 cashiers for 9/11/2017 with Shift1.
-Verified in SPSM that all 9 cashier Shift1 reports show CLOSED on 9/11/2017 with times around 2:20pm.
-LiveLinkServiceHelper shows 'Store Number: 00821' and 'Configured ID: Not Set'.
-Verified the POS server can reach eRetailer.
Continuing troubleshooting:
-Stopped and started SQL Server MX, Radiant .NET, MacromatiX Livelink, MacromatiX Updater services one at a time.
-Stopped Radiant .NET, SQL Server (MS), MacromatiX LiveLink, MacromatiX Updater services in sequence.
-Started Radiant .NET, SQL Server (MS), MacromatiX LiveLink, MacromatiX Updater services in sequence.
-In LiveLinkServiceHelper seeing errors still including:
"2017-09-12 18:04:08.3046 UTC - Exception occurred actioning main polling tasks (PollReason=OneMinuteTimer). Exception: System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: Cannot open database "MacromatiX" requested by the login. The login failed. Login failed for user 'NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM'."
-Stopped both MacromatiX LiveLink and Updater 
-From command prompt, dropped 'macromatix' database.
-Started both MacromatiX LiveLink and Updater 

Still receiving errors in LiveLinkServiceHelper.

-Stopped MacromatiX LiveLink
-Tried to drop database 'macromatix' again but it failed due to the database not being re-attached.
-Backed up the database files.
-Restarted MacromatiX LiveLink service.
-Database was successfully reattached.

LiveLink now shows 'Configured ID: 491'.
LiveLink is now successfully processing and all cashiers are showing up in inForm.

Verified in inFORM that cashiers are now showing in Cashier Settlement and are green.</text>

    <text>Aloha Environment For Testing Connectivity:
===================================
ping cfamemberlink.alohaenterprise.com


Additional Notes:
--------------------------
With Sigma, we used to ping Aloha from the POS server before every Loyalty call was made. This resulted in a lot of Loyalty traffic clogging up the pipes to Aloha which caused poor performance, especially with iPOS. With the new REST API Loyalty Thin Client, we don’t test the connection before a Loyalty call is submitted. If the call times out, then we go into offline mode and start the 5-minute ping cycle to cfamemberlink.alohaenterprise.com which is what you see in Message logs. I’m pushing for NCR to lower that 5-minute time though to something much more frequent. That way, we can get back online more quickly but still won’t clog up the pipes with multiple calls per transaction.

If signature line doesn't print on a receipt when the amount charged is over the limit setup in SPEP,  the problem is likely that the receipt printer in LHDevCfg is not setup for 'Credit receipt print type'.

    <name>e355 Charger Work Note</name>
    <text>We currently are unable to provide addtional spare chargers due to our supply being extremely limited.  
By mid-October all stores with E355s will be shipped the new upgraded charger for their E355s, less those who have already been shipped the ‘B’ charger (there is a large B on the plug label).

If their chargers are defective, we can submit them for possible replacement, please ask the restaurant to hold onto that one as we will want to send them a return label so we can have Verifone inspect them!  

Note, once the ‘B’ chargers have been shipped to all the stores, unless there is an incorrect quantity shipped to them we will not be provided chargers to ship to the restaurants as replacements.  Stores will need to order and purchase them via the Verifone Estore.  KB0056792.</text>
